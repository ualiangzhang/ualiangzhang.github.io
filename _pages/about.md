I am a passionate researcher in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with extensive experience in exploring cutting-edge technologies and solving complex challenges. I look forward to sharing my research journey and insights with you.

About Me
======
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and have extensive experience in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-centric technologies. Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous research projects, publications, and collaborations. As a Research Scientist at the University of Arizona, I remain deeply engaged in advancing cutting-edge research and fostering innovation.

My primary research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including:

- Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Cybersecurity
- Scientific Knowledge Extraction

[//]: # (My current research focuses on [SKEMA: Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Model Analysis]&#40;https://github.com/ml4ai/skema&#41;, a project aims at extracting and integrating knowledge from scientific literature using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. This endeavor reflects my dedication to solving complex problems in artificial intelligence, and I am excited to share the findings and insights from this ongoing work.)
