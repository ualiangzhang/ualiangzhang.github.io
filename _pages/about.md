I am a dedicated researcher and scholar in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With a passion for pushing the boundaries of knowledge and a commitment to academic excellence, I am delighted to share my work, research interests, and academic journey with you.

About Me
======
I hold a PhD degree in electrical engineering. My academic career has been marked by a relentless pursuit of understanding artificial intelligence and signal processing, contributing to the academic community through a multitude of research projects, publications, and collaborations. As a research scientist at University of Arizona, I continue to engage in cutting-edge research and educational endeavors.

My primary research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including:

- Scientific Knowledge Extraction
- Cybersecurity
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Signal Processing

My current research focuses on [SKEMA: Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Model Analysis](https://github.com/ml4ai/skema), a project aimed at extracting and integrating knowledge from scientific literature using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. This endeavor reflects my dedication to solving complex problems in artificial intelligence, and I am excited to share the findings and insights from this ongoing work.
